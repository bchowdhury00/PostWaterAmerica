SQLite Left Join
- We can use this function as a way to display the user's bog from the entries table. All the blog entries that are not made by a specific user would be NULL which wouldn't be displayed.
- This can apply to our team as we can use left join to find entries from each topic of the blogs.
SQLite Inner Join
- We can use this function to access data from the entries table using a user's ID. This function looks for a specific value of a heading and returns the specific data required by the coder. 
- This can apply to our team as we can use inner join to find blogs associated with topics made by users based on id or other characteristics. 
SQLite Cross Join
- We can use this function to merge two tables into one table which has M X N rows where M is the number of rows from one table and N is the number of rows from the other table.
- This can be used to 

Actions we will take toward being more awesome:
1. We will better communicate as a team and understand the task at hand so we can develop a better functional final product rather than a makeshift one.
2. We shouldn't turn to advice and help on the internet as no one really knows the error at hand as there is always error something. In addition, the internet is a dangerous, unreliable, and untrustworthy place to be in (4chan) and it is better to consult classmates and peers.
3. Breaks are necessary as coding all day will slowly drive you insane. Your brain isn't good at basic logic, much less complex logic. Therefore, rest for your brains are necessary in preventing you from going crazy. The brain functions better with rest as well.

Started work on creating database. Created the foundation for the login table but will have to consult for further inquiries with team in regards to blog table.
