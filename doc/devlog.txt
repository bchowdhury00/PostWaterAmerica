SQLite Left Join
We can use this function as a way to display the user's bog from the entries table. All the blog entries that are not made by a specific user would be NULL which wouldn't be displayed.
SQLiter Inner Join
We can use this function to access data from the entries table using a user's ID. This function looks for a specific value of a heading and returns the specific data required by the coder.
