SQLite Left Join
- We can use this function as a way to display the user's bog from the entries table. All the blog entries that are not made by a specific user would be NULL which wouldn't be displayed.
SQLite Inner Join
- We can use this function to access data from the entries table using a user's ID. This function looks for a specific value of a heading and returns the specific data required by the coder. 
SQLite Cross Join
- We can use this function to merge two tables into one table which has M X N rows where M is the number of rows from one table and N is the number of rows from the other table.
